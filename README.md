Simple MiniMessage for Whitelist (SMMW)
---
Could not find a paper plugin for something like this, had to make my own. Took roughly 30 minutes from start to finish.

# This plugin only supports 1.19.4

Commands
---
- /smmw view - sends the formatted messages to the sender
- /smmw set [message] - sets the message string as the new whitelist kick message

The message is stored in default config (config.yml).
