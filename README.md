Simple MiniMessage for Whitelist (SMMW)
---
Could not find a paper plugin for something like this, had to make my own. Took roughly 30 minutes from start to finish.

The message is stored in default config (config.yml).

Commands
---
/smmw view - sends the formatted messages to the sender
/smmw set [message] - sets the message string as the new whitelist kick message
